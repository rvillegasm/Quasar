# Quasar
Quasar is a rendering engine written in modern C++, with portability 
in mind.

Currently, it only supports Linux, because it is being developed in
that environment, but support for MacOs and Windows will come in the future,
when the basic functionalities of the engine have been implemented.

## More information comming soon!
